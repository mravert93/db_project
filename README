This serves as a README for the front-end portion of this project. 

There have been no project deviations from our progress report. We are still using MySQL and Django. 

The db_project folder can be placed anywhere on your machine that you would like. Once this is done, the path structure should be just fine how it is. 

Directories:
Important files in the app directory include models.py and views.py. 

Models.py contains the various models for our porject including player, team, map, and weapon models. It also includes Django specific models which are not too important to our project. 

Views.py contains all of the different views for our project including player, team, weapon, map, and team_page views. There are also views for the various CRUD operations needed in this project.
